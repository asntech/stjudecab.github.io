The Transcriptomics Group focuses on transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs including bulk gene expression, single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome). We also integrate RNA-seq data with other high throughput sequencing data such as epigenomics data to better understand the biology.  In addition, the group is interested in establishing analytic/visualization pipelines to support the work of St. Jude investigators.

We are expereinced in data analysis on areas related to:
- Cancer Biology
- Cancer Immunotherapy
- Developmental Biology

We categorized Transcriptomics Analyses into three major topics:
1. **Differential gene expression**: Identify differentially expressed gene using high thoughput data such as RNA-seq at both bulk and single cell level.
2. **splicing and fusion detection**: Identify alternative splicing and fusion events using RNA-seq.
3. **Data integation**: Integrate RNA-seq data with epigenomics data such as DNA methylation to better understand the biology.


#### Technologies and methods
The CAB transcriptomics is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods to analyze biological data. The main platforms are:
- RNA-Seq/SLAM-Seq/scRNA
- ChIP-Seq 
- ATAC-Seq/scATAC
- WGBS

#### Joining St. Jude

#### Funding
We are grateful for funding from the [National Cancer Institute at National Institute of Health](https://www.cancer.gov/)
