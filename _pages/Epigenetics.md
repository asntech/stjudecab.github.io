The SJCAB Epigenetics Group focuses on helping researchers answer biological questions related to regulation through epigenetic mechanisms using the best available tools. We are also interested in establishing new analytic pipelines to enhance researching practices of St. Jude investigators. We mainly expereinced on areas:
- Cancer Biology
- Developmental Biology
- Innate Immunology

We categorized Epigenetics Analyses briefly into three major topics:
1. **Regulation discovery**: Discover and predict regulation relationship using NGS data such as ChIP-Seq and intergrative with other data.
2. **Chromatin state**: Chromatin accessibility can be measure by method such as ATAC-seq, DNase-seq. Together with motif database, transcription factors (TFs) likely to associated with differential accessible regions can be identified.
3. **3D Genome**: Thanks to [Chromosome conformation capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_conformation_capture)(3C) technologies or 3C-based methods, people are able to study the 3D structure of chromatin. [Topological association domains (TADs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_associating_domain), [Compartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_organization#A/B_compartments), [Chromatin loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_organization#DNA_looping) were all found could regulated gene's functions.

#### Technologies and methods
The SJCAB Epigenetics is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including:
- ChIP-Seq
- ATAC-Seq/scATAC
- RNA-Seq/SLAM-Seq/scRNA
- HiC/HiCHIP/PLAC-Seq/CaptureC

#### Funding
We are grateful for funding from the [National Cancer Institute at National Institute of Health](https://www.cancer.gov/)
