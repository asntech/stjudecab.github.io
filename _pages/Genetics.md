The CAB Genetics Group focuses on the association of inherited or acquired genetic variations with clinical or phenotypic traits in humans. We are also interested in establishing new bioinformatic and statistical pipelines to enhance researching practices of St. Jude investigators. 

---
We mainly focus on these areas:

- Germline pediatric cancer
- Pediatric neurogenetics
- Annotations and interpretation of non-coding variants

#### We categorized Genetics Analyses briefly into three major topics:

- **Individual studies**: ACMG/AMP 2015 classification of germline variants.
- **Family studies**: Segregation and filtering approaches for novel variant discovery.
- **Cohort studies**: Testing and application of published methods for single variant, gene-based, and pathway-level analyses of large cohorts.  

#### Technologies and methods

The CAB Genetics Group is primarily a statistical genetics/bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including:

- Amplicon sequencing
- WES
- WGS
- RNA-Seq
