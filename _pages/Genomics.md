The CAB Genomics Group focuses incorporate state-of-art analytic approaches to understand how the tumorigenesis and relevant biological processes shaped by genomic variations. The team is also of interests in establishing genomics analytic pipelines to support the work of St. Jude investigators.

---
We mainly focus on these areas:

- Cancer genomics
- Germline genomics
- Metagenomics
- Comparative/Evolutionary genomics
- Viral genomics

#### We categorized Genomics Analyses briefly into several major topics:

- **Cancer Genomics**: Study of the totality of DNA sequence variations between tumor cells and normal cells
- **Germline Genomics**: Different from acquired somatic mutations, occurs in reproductive cells (sperm, egg) and inherits to the offspring
- **Meta-genomics**: 16S Operational Taxonomic Units(OTU) analysis
- **Comparative/Evolutionary genomics**: Guided/de novo Genome assembly, gene annotation, evolution analysis
- **Viral genomics**: Viral genome assembly, annotation, phylogenetic history reconstruction

#### Technologies and methods

The CAB Genomics Group is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including:

- Whole exome sequencing
- Long read sequencing (Pacbio, 10X and Oxford Nanopore)
- Amplicon sequencing (Customized Capture, 16S rRNA, CRISPR screening)
