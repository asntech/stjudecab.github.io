SJCRH Center for Applied Bioinformatics (CAB) is an institutional shared resource, with the mission to provide state-of-the-art bioinformatics services to St. Jude investigators. We maintain the highest level of scientific rigor by carefully vetting and documenting all bioinformatics methods and pipelines. All methods are shared with the international biomedical research community.

At the CAB, we believe that "Discovery Leads to Cure", which is what we are striving for. We also advocate an open science culture and help cultivate a highly collaborative environment for scientific research.
