### Overview
In my work I am a scientist, computational biologist. I use bioinformatics approaches to integrate genomics and epigenomics data and study the pathology of various cancers, like Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Diffused Large B-cell Lymphoma. In combination with numerous existing tools, my programming skills (mostly combination of Python and Bash) allow me to study RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, BS-Seq, ATAC-Seq, Hi-C and so many other datatypes in order to discover the source of tumor malignancy. I am also a huge fun of the "art of data visualization", which helps me and my co-workers, understand the data better.
